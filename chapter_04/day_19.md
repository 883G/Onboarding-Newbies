# Day 17 - Spark Application Deployment :bar_chart:

## Overview:
Thus far, we focused on Spark's properties as a programming interface.
This chapter focuses on what happens when Spark goes about executing that code.
Today, you'll learn how Spark applications are deployed to production as ran.

## **Goals:**
- Dive into the architecture and components of the Spark application.
- Understand low-level execution properties, such as pipelining.

## IV. Production Applications
**Topics Covered:**
- How Spark Runs on a Cluster
- Developing Spark Applications
- Deploying Spark
- Monitoring and Debugging
- Performance Tuning

### How Spark Runs on a Cluster
- The Architecture of a Spark Application
- The Life Cycle of a Spark Application (Outside Spark)
- The Life Cycle of a Spark Application (Inside Spark)
- Execution Details

### Developing Spark Applications
- Writing Spark Applications
- Testing Spark Applications
- The Development Process
- Launching Applications
- Configuring Applications

### Deploying Spark
- Where to Deploy Your Cluster to Run Spark Applications
- Cluster Managers
- Miscellaneous Considerations

### Monitoring and Debugging
- The Monitoring Landscape
- What to Monitor
- Spark Logs
- The Spark UI
- Debugging and Spark First Aid

## **Wrapping Up:** :hourglass_flowing_sand:
**Fantastic work on Day 17! You've explored Spark SQL and its capabilities for structured data processing. Continue practicing and applying Spark SQL in your projects to harness the power of structured data. Tomorrow, we'll disscuss and answer questions about what we've learned so far.**

Discuss with your mentor about the day's learnings and explore potential project applications. Reflect on the significance of Spark SQL and how you can apply these concepts in your big data projects.

**Q&A Session:** :raising_hand:
- Engage in an open Q&A session with your mentor to address any queries or discussions about specific Spark SQL concepts, structured data processing, or the integration of SQL in Spark applications.
- Seek recommendations for further exploration and resources to deepen your understanding of Spark SQL.

## **Action Items:**
- Identify areas for deeper exploration.
- Get recommendations on resources for further learning.
- Reflect on how you can integrate Spark SQL into your current or future projects.
