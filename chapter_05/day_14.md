   - Gain familiarity with commonly used operators such as BashOperator, PythonOperator, and more.

###### 2. **Core Features:**
   - Read about Variables, exaplain the puprose of using them.
   - Read about Connections, give example of a connection we are using.
   - Read about Pools and explain the puprose of them.

### Chapter 3: Advanced Airflow Concepts

- **Topics Covered:**
  - **Custom Operators and Hooks**
    - Techniques for creating custom operators and hooks to extend Airflow's functionality.
  - **XComs (Cross-Communication)**
    - Role of XComs in facilitating communication between tasks within a DAG.
  - **DynamicTaskMapping and TaskGroups**
    - Organizing and managing complex workflows using DynamicTaskMapping and TaskGroups.
  - **Trigger Rules**
    - Configuring trigger rules for defining task dependencies and execution triggers.
  - **Airflow Sensors and Deferrable Operator**
    - What are deferrable operators? Why they help us? Explain the flow when running deferred operator.
    - Implementing sensors for waiting on external conditions before task execution.
  - **Macros and Templating**
    - Using macros and Jinja templating for dynamic task generation and parameterization.
  - **Maintainers**
    - Plugins help us to extend airflow abilities. 
    - Cluster Policies gives us the ability to check or mutate DAGs or Tasks on a cluster-wide level.

##### Core Concepts

###### 1. **Custom Operators and Hooks:**
   - Explore techniques for creating custom operators and hooks to extend Airflow's functionality.
   - Learn best practices for writing reusable and maintainable custom components tailored to specific workflow requirements.

###### 2. **XComs (Cross-Communication):**
   - Understand the role of XComs in facilitating communication between tasks within a DAG.
   - Explore advanced use cases for leveraging XComs to share data and coordinate task execution.

### Wrapping Up the Day

- **Joint Discussion and Q&A (1 hour):**
  - Engage in a collective discussion with mentors and peers to share insights and experiences related to both introduction and advanced Apache Airflow concepts.
  - Address questions and clarify doubts for both junior and senior participants.

**Congratulations to all participants on completing Day 14! You've embarked on a journey to explore Apache Airflow from its foundational concepts to advanced techniques. Keep building on this knowledge to excel in managing and optimizing data workflows with Airflow.**
