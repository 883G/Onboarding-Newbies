#### Chapter 3: Advanced Airflow Concepts

- **Topics Covered:**
  - **Custom Operators and Hooks**
    - Techniques for creating custom operators and hooks to extend Airflow's functionality.
  - **XComs (Cross-Communication)**
    - Role of XComs in facilitating communication between tasks within a DAG.
  - **SubDAGs and TaskGroups**
    - Organizing and managing complex workflows using SubDAGs and TaskGroups.
  - **Trigger Rules**
    - Configuring trigger rules for defining task dependencies and execution triggers.
  - **Airflow Sensors**
    - Implementing sensors for waiting on external conditions before task execution.
  - **Macros and Templating**
    - Using macros and Jinja templating for dynamic task generation and parameterization.

##### Core Concepts

###### 1. **Custom Operators and Hooks:**
   - Explore techniques for creating custom operators and hooks to extend Airflow's functionality.
   - Learn best practices for writing reusable and maintainable custom components tailored to specific workflow requirements.

###### 2. **XComs (Cross-Communication):**
   - Understand the role of XComs in facilitating communication between tasks within a DAG.
   - Explore advanced use cases for leveraging XComs to share data and coordinate task execution.

### Wrapping Up the Day

- **Joint Discussion and Q&A (1 hour):**
  - Engage in a collective discussion with mentors and peers to share insights and experiences related to both introduction and advanced Apache Airflow concepts.
  - Address questions and clarify doubts for both junior and senior participants.
