# üß™ Trino Hands-On Practice: Setting Up Catalogs and Querying External Data
## üéØ Goals
* Deploy a local Trino environment using Docker Compose.

* Configure Trino to connect to external data sources (Hive on MinIO and TPCH).

* Upload data using MinIO and query it using Trino.

* Learn how Trino federates data from different catalogs.

üß± Step 1: Environment Setup
Clone the starter repository or download the setup files provided by your instructor.

Run:
```
git clone https://github.com/883G/Onboarding-Newbies.git
cd ./chapter_06/exercise_files/trino-compose
docker compose up -d
```
This starts the following services:

* Trino

* Minio (S3-compatible storage)

* Hms (Hive Metastore)

* PostgresDb (mainly used by hms)

Access Trino Web UI:
üëâ http://localhost:8080

Access MinIO UI:
üëâ http://localhost:9000
Login:

Access Key: trino-compose

Secret Key: trino-compose

üìÅ Step 2: Upload External Data to MinIO
In the MinIO UI:

Create a bucket named warehouse

Upload the provided CSV file (chapter_06/exercise_files/assests/orders_sample.csv) into a folder:
warehouse/orders/


‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Add a Hive Catalog
* Create a file named hive.properties in etc\catalog\hive.properties
* Add needed config as shown at [trino docs]("https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/hive.html").

It might take some trail and error, Dont be afraid!

Restart Trino (and anwaer in a file why reatart is needed)?

```
docker compose restart trino
```

In Trino CLI/Web UI, run:
##todo finish
now create schema named default in hive catalog only if not exist (docume)

CREATE TABLE hive.default.orders (
  o_orderkey BIGINT,
  o_custkey BIGINT,
  o_orderstatus VARCHAR,
  o_totalprice DOUBLE,
  o_orderdate DATE,
  o_orderpriority VARCHAR,
  o_clerk VARCHAR,
  o_shippriority INTEGER,
  o_comment VARCHAR
)
WITH (
  external_location = 's3a://warehouse/orders/',
  format = 'CSV',
  skip_header_line_count = 1
);

SELECT * FROM hive.default.orders LIMIT 10;
üìä Step 4: Add TPCH Catalog
Create a file named tpch.properties in trino/catalog/:

properties
Copy
Edit
connector.name=tpch
Restart Trino (again) and verify:

sql
Copy
Edit
SHOW SCHEMAS FROM tpch;
SHOW TABLES FROM tpch.tiny;
Run a simple query:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT name, regionkey FROM tpch.tiny.nation LIMIT 5;
üîÄ Step 5: Join Hive and TPCH Data
Try a federated query that joins both sources:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT
  o.o_orderkey,
  o.o_custkey,
  o.o_orderdate,
  n.name AS nation
FROM
  hive.default.orders o
JOIN
  tpch.tiny.nation n
ON
  o.o_custkey = n.nationkey
LIMIT 10;
üß† Reflection Questions
What would happen if the catalog file had a typo?

How does Trino query two completely separate data sources in one query?

What happens if you restart only the Hive Metastore?

## **Wrapping Up:** :hourglass_flowing_sand:
Reflect on today's learning's with your mentor and peers. Discuss potential projects or use cases where you can apply Trino for distributed query processing and analytics. Consider how Trino can enhance your data analysis capabilities and streamline your data workflows.
