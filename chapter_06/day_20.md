# üß™ Trino Hands-On Practice: Setting Up Catalogs and Querying External Data

## üéØ Goals
- Deploy a local Trino environment using Docker Compose.
- Configure Trino catalogs (Hive on MinIO and TPCH).
- Upload data using MinIO and query it using Trino.
- Learn how create Trino query using different catalogs.

üìå **Note:**  
There are several questions in this exercise. Please answer them in a separate file and send them to your mentor.

---

### üß± Step 1: Environment Setup

Clone the starter repository and start the environment:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/883G/Onboarding-Newbies.git
cd ./Onboarding-Newbies/chapter_06/exercise_files/trino-compose
docker compose up -d
```

This will start the following services:
- **Trino**
- **MinIO** (S3-compatible object storage)
- **Hive Metastore**
- **PostgresDB** (used by Hive Metastore for metadata storage)

Access the interfaces:
- Trino UI: üëâ [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- MinIO UI: üëâ [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000)

**Login credentials for MinIO:**

```
Access Key: trino-compose  
Secret Key: trino-compose
```

---

### üìÅ Step 2: Upload External Data to MinIO

1. Open MinIO UI.
2. Create a **new bucket** named: `warehouse` (Don`t create it as path under datalake! create your own bucket!)
3. Upload the provided CSV file located at:
   ```
   chapter_06/exercise_files/assets/orders_sample.csv
   ```
   into the following path:
   ```
   /warehouse/orders_sample.csv
   ```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Add a Hive Catalog

1. Create a file named `hive.properties` in the following path:
   ```
   etc/catalog/hive.properties
   ```
2. Add the required configuration for the Hive connector.  
   Refer to the official documentation for help:  
   [Hive Connector ‚Äì Trino Docs](https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/hive.html)

‚úçÔ∏è  Add your config and explanation in the answers file.

> üß™ It might take some trial and error‚Äîdon‚Äôt be afraid to experiment!

3. Restart Trino to load the new catalog:

```bash
docker compose restart trino
```

‚úçÔ∏è **Answer:** Why is a restart required after adding the catalog? Document your explanation in the answer file.

4. Use Trino CLI:
- Create the `default` schema in the Hive catalog if it doesn't already exist.
- Create an **external table** pointing to the CSV file uploaded to MinIO.
  - Remember to **skip the header** row in the file.
- try quering the newly created table

  > How to use trino cli? </br>
  > Enter Docker Desktop -> Find the Trino container -> Click Exec in the Trino container -> Write ```trino ```

‚úçÔ∏è Document how you created the schema and table in your answers.

---

### üìä Step 4: Add TPCH Catalog

1. Create a file named `tpch.properties` in:
   ```
   etc/catalog/tpch.properties
   ```
2. Add the TPCH connector configuration as shown in:  
   [TPCH Connector ‚Äì Trino Docs](https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/tpch.html)

3. Restart the cluster:

```bash
docker compose restart trino
```

4. Query the TPCH catalog to test it, for example scan 10 rows.

---

### üîÄ Step 5: Join Hive and TPCH Data

1. Write a query that **joins data** from both the Hive and TPCH catalogs.  

2. Visit the Trino UI at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

3. Locate the query you just executed and explore the query details like(and explain about those):
- Execution time
- CPU time (explain how come is it longer than the excution time)

‚úçÔ∏è In the answer file, document the join query and **at least 3 query statistics from the Trino Web UI**, and explain what each of them means.

---

### üß† Reflection Questions

All answers should be documented in file!

1. What would happen if the catalog file had a typo?  
2. How does Trino query two completely separate data sources in one query(technically)?  
3. What happens if you restart only the Hive Metastore?


## **Wrapping Up:** :hourglass_flowing_sand:
Reflect on today's learning's with your mentor and peers. Discuss potential projects or use cases where you can apply Trino for distributed query processing and analytics. Consider how Trino can enhance your data analysis capabilities and streamline your data workflows.
