## 6. MapReduce Programming Model
- [MapReduce Tutorial](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core/MapReduceTutorial.html)

MapReduce is a Java-based, distributed execution framework within the Apache Hadoop Ecosystem.  It takes away the complexity of distributed programming by exposing two processing steps that developers implement: **1) Map** and **2) Reduce**. In the Mapping step, data is split between parallel processing tasks. Transformation logic can be applied to each chunk of data. Once completed, the Reduce phase takes over to handle aggregating data from the Map set. In general, MapReduce uses Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for both input and output. However, some technologies built on top of it, such as Sqoop, allow access to relational systems.

### Core Concepts

A MapReduce system is usually composed of three steps (even though it's generalized as the combination of Map and Reduce operations/functions). The MapReduce operations are:

#### 1. **Map:** 
- The input data is first split into smaller blocks. The Hadoop framework then decides how many mappers to use, based on the size of the data to be processed and the memory block available on each mapper server. Each block is then assigned to a mapper for processing. Each ‘worker’ node applies the map function to the local data, and writes the output to temporary storage. The primary (master) node ensures that only a single copy of the redundant input data is processed.

#### 2. **Shuffle:**
- combine and partition: worker nodes redistribute data based on the output keys (produced by the map function), such that all data belonging to one key is located on the same worker node. As an optional process the combiner (a reducer) can run individually on each mapper server to reduce the data on each mapper even further making reducing the data footprint and shuffling and sorting easier. Partition (not optional) is the process that decides how the data has to be presented to the reducer and also assigns it to a particular reducer.

#### 3. **Reduce:**
- A reducer cannot start while a mapper is still in progress. Worker nodes process each group of <key,value> pairs output data, in parallel to produce <key,value> pairs as output. All the map output values that have the same key are assigned to a single reducer, which then aggregates the values for that key. Unlike the map function which is mandatory to filter and sort the initial data, the reduce function is optional.

## 7. Hadoop YARN
- [Apache Hadoop YARN](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html)

YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) is a fundamental component in the Hadoop ecosystem, serving as a resource management layer to efficiently share resources among multiple applications in a Hadoop cluster.

### Core Concepts

#### 1. Resource Manager (RM)
- Central component managing and allocating resources across the Hadoop cluster.
- Keeps track of available resources and schedules applications based on their resource requirements.

#### 2. Node Manager (NM)
- Runs on each machine in the cluster, managing resources (CPU, memory, etc.) on that specific node.
- Communicates with the Resource Manager to provide information about available resources and request resources for running applications.

#### 3. Application Master (AM)
- Created for each application submitted to YARN.
- Negotiates with the Resource Manager to obtain resources and coordinates the execution of tasks on Node Managers.
- Acts as a liaison between the application and the resource manager.

#### 4. Container
- Fundamental unit of resource allocation in YARN.
- Represents the allocated resources (CPU, memory) on a specific node for a particular application.
- Applications may consist of one or more containers.

#### 5. Application Lifecycle
- When a client submits a job to YARN, an Application Master is created for that job.
- The Application Master negotiates with the Resource Manager to obtain resources and launches containers on the Node Managers.
- Containers execute the tasks of the application.

#### 6. Schedulers
- YARN supports different schedulers, such as CapacityScheduler and FairScheduler.
- CapacityScheduler allows sharing resources among multiple queues with allocated capacities.
- FairScheduler assigns resources in a balanced manner, ensuring that all applications get a fair share.

#### 7. Resource Allocation
- YARN supports dynamic resource allocation, allowing applications to request additional resources or release unused resources during runtime.
- This flexibility enables optimal resource utilization based on the varying needs of applications.

#### 8. Fault Tolerance
- YARN provides fault tolerance by monitoring the health of Node Managers and restarting failed containers on healthy nodes.
- Ensures the reliability of applications by handling node failures and container restarts.

#### 9. Security
- YARN includes security features such as authentication and authorization to control access to cluster resources.
- Helps maintain the integrity and security of the Hadoop cluster.

#### 10. Preemption
- Preemption is a feature in YARN that allows the Resource Manager to interrupt and reclaim resources from running applications.
- Useful in multi-tenant environments where higher-priority applications may need resources currently allocated to lower-priority applications.

#### 11. Queue
- In the context of Apache Hadoop YARN, a "queue" refers to a logical subdivision or container for managing and allocating resources within a cluster.
- YARN queues play a crucial role in the resource management layer, allowing organizations to control how resources are shared among different applications or user groups.
- Queues facilitate multi-tenancy by providing distinct containers for different teams or applications, preventing resource contention and ensuring efficient workload isolation.

### Real-World Examples:
In real-world scenarios, Apache Hadoop YARN serves as a crucial resource management layer, enabling dynamic resource allocation and workload diversity. Here are detailed examples showcasing the practical applications of Apache Hadoop YARN:
