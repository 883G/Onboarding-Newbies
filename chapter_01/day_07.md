# Day 07 - Introduction to Impala :elephant:

## Overview:
Today's session dives dipper into the world of data analytics. You'll explore Hadoop's data analytics tool - Impala.

**The focus is on gaining a deeper understanding of data-analytics as a concept, it's implementation in Hadoop - Hive and it's purposes in the ecosystem.**

## Goals:
- Gain a foundational understanding of the data analysis concept.
- Explore it's role in big data processing.
- Make connections between the Hadoop ecosystem to real-world use cases of data analysis.
- Gain an understanding of Impala - How and Why?.
- Understand the difference between Hive & Impala, as well as their integration together.

:warning: **Note:**
- This is a self-study day, it is important to be able to work independently and manage your time.
- A lot of newbies have a problem with self-study and time management, so breath and take your time to plan your day carefully.
- Be aware of the importance of time management. 
- Plan your time and tasks, and try to stick to your plan. If you are not able to finish the tasks in the time you have planned, you should discuss it with your mentor, maybe you learn more then you should.
- You need to understand the **full picture** of every concept, so take your time to understand it, *if you can't explain it, you don't understand it*.
- You need to be able to explain each concept and how it relates to the others and how it can be used in real-world scenarios.
- This chapter will cover the essential concepts of the Hadoop ecosystem, and you will have a Q&A session with your mentor to discuss what you have learned.
- To gain a deeper understanding of the concepts and how they are applied in real-world scenarios we'll provide you with key concepts and a brief explanation for each core concept. Your task is to delve deeper into each concept by researching them. 
- Utilize Google, YouTube, or any other reliable source to gather comprehensive information that helps you grasp each concept thoroughly. This preparation will equip you for a productive question-and-answer session with your mentor, where you'll be expected to discuss what you've learned.
- **Before you start**  take a look to the [Exercise](#excercise) and try to understand what you need to do, so you can focus on the main concepts that you need to learn. don't waste your time on the concepts and details that you don't need to know.
- If you have any questions and have conflicts if you need to learn some concept or not, you should discuss it with your mentor.

## 11. Apache Impala

### Core Concepts
1. **Impala Daemon:**
   - Fundamental processing unit in Impala, responsible for executing queries and managing data distribution.
   - Impala daemons are distributed across the cluster to ensure parallel processing.
2. **Table:**
   - Similar to a table in a relational database, tables in Impala store structured data.
   - Tables can be external, managed, or virtual, each with its own characteristics.
3. **Schema:**
   - A blueprint that defines the structure of tables and their columns in Impala.
   - Schemas help maintain data integrity and organization within the database.
4. **SQL Support:**
   - Impala supports SQL-92 and SQL-2003 standards, allowing users to write complex queries.
   - It also offers various SQL extensions to optimize query performance.
5. **Query Execution:**
   - Impala uses a massively parallel processing (MPP) architecture to execute queries efficiently.
   - Queries are distributed across multiple Impala daemons for faster execution.
6. **Data Formats:**
   - Impala supports various file formats like Parquet, Avro, and ORC for efficient data storage and retrieval.
   - Choosing the right data format is crucial for query performance.
7. **Catalog Service:**
   - Manages metadata about tables, schemas, and other database objects.
   - Helps optimize query planning and execution by storing essential metadata.
   - Draws it's the data from Hive's metastore.
8. **Query Coordinator:**
   - Coordinates query execution and optimization across the Impala cluster.
   - Decides how to distribute queries to Impala daemons for maximum efficiency.
9. **Partitioning:**
   - Partitioning in Impala involves dividing tables into smaller, manageable units based on specific criteria.
   - It improves query performance by reducing the amount of data scanned.
10. **User-Defined Functions (UDFs):**
    - Allows users to create custom functions in Python, C++, or Java for advanced data processing.
    - UDFs enhance Impala's flexibility in handling complex tasks.
11. **Refresh and Invalidate:**
    - **Refresh:** Impala allows you to refresh metadata about tables and schemas, ensuring that the latest changes are reflected in queries.
    - **Invalidate:** You can also invalidate metadata to force Impala to recompute it, ensuring data consistency and accuracy.
12. **Impala Shell:**
      - Impala Shell is a command-line interface for interacting with Impala.
      - It allows users to execute queries, manage database objects, and perform other administrative tasks.
13. **StateStore:**
    - A critical component in Impala that maintains the overall state of the Impala daemons within the cluster.
    - It ensures high availability and consistency across the cluster by syncing metadata and query states, allowing Impala daemons to recover and continue processing in case of failures.
    - The StateStore plays a vital role in distributing configuration changes and updates, ensuring that each daemon has the latest view of the cluster's state.

14. **Topics in Impala:**
    - Topics in Impala refer to the communication channels used by the StateStore to broadcast updates and messages to Impala daemons.
    - These topics ensure that critical information like metadata changes, query states, or daemon health is efficiently propagated across the cluster, maintaining the cluster's overall health and coordination.


### Real-World Use Cases
1. **Interactive SQL Queries:**
   - Impala is ideal for interactive SQL queries on large datasets, providing real-time responses for analytics and reporting.
2. **Data Exploration:**
   - Analysts and data scientists can use Impala to explore data quickly and perform ad-hoc analysis, gaining valuable insights.
3. **ETL Processing:**
   - Impala supports efficient Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) operations, making it suitable for data transformation tasks.
4. **Business Intelligence (BI):**
   - Impala integrates seamlessly with BI tools like Tableau, Qlik, and Power BI, enabling easy data visualization and reporting.
5. **Data Warehousing:**
   - Impala can serve as a high-performance data warehouse, handling complex queries and supporting concurrent users.
6. **IoT Data Processing:**
   - With its ability to handle high-speed data streams, Impala is suitable for processing IoT data for real-time monitoring and analysis.

In summary, Apache Impala is a powerful tool for SQL-based data processing, offering real-time query performance and versatility for a wide range of use cases in the big data ecosystem.
