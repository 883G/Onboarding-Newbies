# 883 Group Onboarding - Newbies :baby_bottle:

Welcome to the 883 Group Onboarding for Newbies! This repository is your gateway to a structured 10-chapter program, designed to seamlessly integrate you into our dynamic Data Ops team. 
The onboarding program is designed like "100 DAYS OF CODE", each chapter divided into days, and each day is dedicated to a specific topic or skill set that you'll be exploring.
Each day will have a set of tasks, goals, and resources to guide you through the learning process. You'll also have the opportunity to engage in discussions, Q&A sessions, and hands-on exercises to reinforce your understanding and apply your knowledge in real-world scenarios.

#### **PAY ATTENTION**: :warning:
- Day is not a day, it's just a session.
