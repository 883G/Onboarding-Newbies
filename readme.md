# 883 Group Onboarding Project :whale: :sparkles:

## Overview

Welcome to the 883 Group, a collective of high-performing teams driving innovation in Data Ops. You're about to embark on an enlightening journey with the 883 Group Onboarding Project. This repository is your comprehensive guide through a structured 10-chapter program, meticulously designed to integrate you into our multifaceted team. You'll navigate through the complexities of the Hadoop Ecosystem and advance into sophisticated topics involving Apache Airflow, Kubernetes, and Spark.

Our objective is to ensure a smooth and comprehensive onboarding experience. Thus, this repository is bifurcated into two core sections â€” 'newbie', tailored for you, the new team member, and 'mentor', crafted to guide our experienced team members in mentoring you effectively.

## Structure

The repository is thoughtfully segmented into two principal folders, each meticulously organized to cater to the respective needs of newbies and mentors:

### Newbie :baby_bottle:
The 'newbie' folder is your learning sanctuary, filled with rich educational content, practical exercises, and vital resources. Each chapter is structured to progressively build upon the last, ensuring a comprehensive understanding and expertise in each topic.

**Chapter Format:**
- **Days 00 - 99 (`day_00.md`, `day_01.md`, ..., `day_90.md`):** Each day introduces a new concept or a deeper dive into the chapter's topic, complete with explanations, examples, and hands-on exercises.
- **Final Exercise(`final_excersie.md`):** Reserved for review, reflection, and consolidation of the chapter's learning. This day may also include group discussions or Q&A sessions to address any uncertainties or challenges.
- **`showcase.md`:** A practical assignment, research or project that applies the chapter's learning, reinforcing concepts and allowing for real-world application.


**Roadmap of Subjects:**
1. **chapter 1:** Introduction to Data Ops and Hadoop Ecosystem
2. **chapter 2:** Proficiency in Spark
3. **chapter 3:** Mastering Apache Airflow for Workflow Orchestration
4. **chapter 4:** DevOps in Kubernetes
5. **chapter 5:** Iceberg and Trino in Data Operations
6. **chapter 6:** Operators and Controllers in Kubernetes
7. **chapter 7:** Real-world Project Simulation
8. **chapter 8:** Best Practices and Spark Optimization
9. **chapter 9:** Advanced Airflow Concepts and Practical Implementation
10. **chapter 10:** Documentation and Knowledge Sharing

## How to Use This Repository

### For Newbies
