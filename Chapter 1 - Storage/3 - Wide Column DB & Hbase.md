# Introduction to HBase :elephant:

> **Note:** this document was renamed earlier to `Wide Column DB & Hbase` to reflect the broader category; the title remains centered on HBase for now.

## Overview
Today’s session dives deeper into column‑oriented databases with a focus on Apache HBase, the Hadoop ecosystem’s wide‑column store. (The filename has been updated to “Wide Column DB & Hbase” per reviewer suggestion.) Understanding HBase will help you see how low‑latency random access is provided over massive data sets.

**The emphasis is on HBase’s architecture, core components, and operational model.**

## Goals
- Grasp the columnar database model and why HBase exists.
- Learn the responsibilities of key HBase components (RegionServer, ZooKeeper, HFile, etc.).
- Improve your ability to plan and self‑direct learning.

:warning: **Note:**
- This is a self‑study day; independence and time management are crucial.
- If you can’t explain a concept clearly, you probably need to revaisit it.
- Read the [Exercise](#exercise) before starting so you know what to emphasize.
- Ask your mentor if you’re unsure what to research.

### ⏳ Timeline
Estimated Duration: 3 Days
- Day 1: Learn the concepts of wide column DB and HBASE spesficly; spend the day.
- Day 2-3: Get deep into HBASE spesficly
    - Have a Q&A session at the third day and in between sessions each day

## Core Concepts

## Part 1: Wide Column Databases (General Concepts)

Answer these questions to understand the fundamentals of wide-column databases before focusing on HBase:

1. **Data Model & Structure:**  
   What is a wide-column database, and how does its data model work? Explain the concepts of rows, column families, and flexible schemas. How does this model differ from traditional relational databases and key-value stores?

2. **Use Cases & Motivation:**  
   Why do wide-column databases exist? In what scenarios are they most useful (for example: large-scale datasets, time-series data, sparse data, or systems requiring high write throughput)?

3. **Distributed Design:**  
   How do wide-column databases distribute data across clusters? Explain concepts such as partitioning, replication, and horizontal scalability.

### Part 2: Apache HBase (Implementation & Operations)

Answer these five questions to cover HBase’s major areas:

1. **Architecture & Data Model:**  
   Describe the overall architecture of Apache HBase, including tables, rows keyed by row key, column families, regions, and the storage format (HFile). How do these elements differ from a traditional relational database, and why is schema design driven by access patterns?

2. **Components & Storage Flow:**  
   Explain the roles of RegionServers, MemStore, HFiles, block cache, and the Write-Ahead Log (WAL). How does data flow from a client write to durable storage, and how are reads served from memory and disk structures?

3. **Performance & Maintenance:**  
   What are minor and major compactions, MOB storage, Bloom filters, and caching? How do they affect read/write latency, storage efficiency, and amplification? Discuss the importance of row-key design and hotspot avoidance.

4. **Fault Tolerance & Coordination:**  
   How does HBase use WAL replay, region reassignment, and coordination via ZooKeeper to handle failures and maintain availability? What happens when a RegionServer crashes?

5. **Scalability & Operations:**  
   Discuss how HBase scales horizontally through region splitting and balancing, how it relies on HDFS for durability, and what administrative actions (snapshots, backups, schema changes, recovery) operators perform in production environments.
### 🔄 Alternatives
Assignment: You are required to research and write a comparative analysis between Hbase and an industry alternative.
- Deliverable: A written summary (minimum 1 or 2 sentences).
- Focus: Compare performance, architecture, and specific "pain points" this tool solves compared to legacy systems or competitors.
- Goal: You must be able to justify why the department uses this tool for our specific environment.

### 🎯 User Story & Scenario
Assignment: Based on your research and understanding of the department's pipeline, define a concrete Use Case for this technology.
- Deliverable: A written summary example/story (two paragraphs approx.).
- Requirement: Describe a real-world scenario (e.g., a specific client requirement) where this technology is the optimal solution.
- Data Flow: Map out the data flow and explain how this tool integrates with other components in the Data Pipeline.

## Wrapping Up :trophy:
Go over your answers with your mentor and clarify any uncertainties. Relate HBase concepts back to the broader data platform.

## Action Items
- Identify HBase topics you want to delve into further.
- Collect a list of real‑world HBase deployments or related technologies.
- Prepare questions for the next mentor Q&A session.
