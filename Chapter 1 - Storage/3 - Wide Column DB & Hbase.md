# Introduction to HBase :elephant:

> **Note:** this document was renamed earlier to `Wide Column DB & Hbase` to reflect the broader category; the title remains centered on HBase for now.

## Overview
Today’s session dives deeper into column‑oriented databases with a focus on Apache HBase, the Hadoop ecosystem’s wide‑column store. (The filename has been updated to “Wide Column DB & Hbase” per reviewer suggestion.) Understanding HBase will help you see how low‑latency random access is provided over massive data sets.

**The emphasis is on HBase’s architecture, core components, and operational model.**

## Goals
- Grasp the columnar database model and why HBase exists.
- Learn the responsibilities of key HBase components (RegionServer, ZooKeeper, HFile, etc.).
- Improve your ability to plan and self‑direct learning.

:warning: **Note:**
- This is a self‑study day; independence and time management are crucial.
- If you can’t explain a concept clearly, you probably need to revisit it.
- Read the [Exercise](#exercise) before starting so you know what to emphasize.
- Ask your mentor if you’re unsure what to research.

## Core Concepts

Answer these five questions to cover HBase’s major areas:

1. **Architecture & Data Model:**  Describe the overall architecture of Apache HBase, including tables, rows keyed by row key, column families, regions, and the storage format (HFile). How do these elements differ from a traditional relational database, and why is schema design driven by access patterns?

2. **Components & Storage Flow:**  Explain the roles of RegionServers, MemStore, HFiles, block cache, and the Write-Ahead Log (WAL). How does data flow from a client write to durable storage, and how are reads served from memory and disk structures?

3. **Performance & Maintenance:**  What are minor and major compactions, MOB storage, Bloom filters, and caching? How do they affect read/write latency, storage efficiency, and amplification? Discuss the importance of row-key design and hotspot avoidance.

4. **Fault Tolerance & Coordination:**  How does HBase use WAL replay, region reassignment, and coordination via Apache ZooKeeper to handle failures and maintain availability? What happens when a RegionServer crashes?

5. **Scalability & Operations:**  Discuss how HBase scales horizontally through region splitting and balancing, how it relies on HDFS for durability, and what administrative actions (snapshots, backups, schema changes, recovery) operators perform in production environments.

## Wrapping Up :trophy:
Go over your answers with your mentor and clarify any uncertainties. Relate HBase concepts back to the broader data platform.

## Action Items
- Identify HBase topics you want to delve into further.
- Collect a list of real‑world HBase deployments or related technologies.
- Prepare questions for the next mentor Q&A session.
