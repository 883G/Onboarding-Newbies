# Object Storage (S3-Compatible) :

## Overview
This session introduces the fundamentals of S3‑compatible object storage systems.  While the term "S3" originates from Amazon, many vendors and open‑source projects implement the same API and concepts.  The goal is to understand how object stores differ from traditional file systems and what design trade‑offs they make.

**Keep the discussion high level; focus on architecture, key operations, and common patterns rather than vendor specifics.**

## Goals
- Learn what distinguishes object storage from block and file storage.
- Understand the S3 API model (buckets, objects, keys, metadata) and semantics.
- Practice planning a self‑study day and managing your time.

:warning: **Note:**
- This is a self‑study day; independence and time management are essential.
- Focus on the big picture—if you can’t explain a concept in your own words, you haven’t learned it.
- Review the [Exercise](#exercise) early to guide your research.
- Consult your mentor if you're unsure which topics to prioritize.

## Core Concepts

Answer the following five questions to cover the main ideas:

1. **Data Model & API:**  Describe the S3 object model (buckets, objects, keys, versions) and how it differs from a hierarchical file system. What are the typical REST operations?
2. **Metadata & Immutability:**  How is metadata handled in S3‑compatible stores? Explain the role of object immutability and versioning.
3. **Consistency & Performance:**  What consistency guarantees do most implementations provide (eventual vs. strong)?  How do multipart uploads and range reads affect performance?
4. **Security & Access Control:**  Outline common authentication/authorization mechanisms (signing requests, ACLs, policies) and how they integrate with buckets and objects.
5. **Deployment & Ecosystem:**  Discuss where S3‑compatible storage is used (cloud, on‑prem, edge) and mention systems like MinIO, Ceph RGW, or commercial offerings. How does the compatibility layer enable ecosystem tooling?

## Wrapping Up :trophy:
Review your answers with your mentor and identify any gaps. Relate these concepts back to the unified storage vocabulary used throughout the course.

## Action Items
- List real‑world object stores you’d like to investigate further.
- Prepare questions for the next mentor Q&A session.
