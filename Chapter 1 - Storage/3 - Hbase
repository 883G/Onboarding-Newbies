# Introduction to HBase :elephant:

## Overview
Today’s session dives deeper into column‑oriented databases with a focus on Apache HBase, the Hadoop ecosystem’s wide‑column store. Understanding HBase will help you see how low‑latency random access is provided over massive data sets.

**The emphasis is on HBase’s architecture, core components, and operational model.**

## Goals
- Grasp the columnar database model and why HBase exists.
- Learn the responsibilities of key HBase components (RegionServer, ZooKeeper, HFile, etc.).
- Improve your ability to plan and self‑direct learning.

:warning: **Note:**
- This is a self‑study day; independence and time management are crucial.
- If you can’t explain a concept clearly, you probably need to revisit it.
- Read the [Exercise](#exercise) before starting so you know what to emphasize.
- Ask your mentor if you’re unsure what to research.

## Core Concepts

Answer these five questions to cover HBase’s major areas:

1. **Architecture & Data Model:**  Describe HBase’s overall architecture, including tables, rows keyed by row key, column families, and the storage format (HFile). How do these elements differ from a traditional relational database?
2. **Components & Storage Flow:**  Explain the roles of RegionServers, regions, MemStore, HFiles, and the Write‑Ahead Log (WAL). How does data flow from a client write to durable storage?
3. **Performance & Maintenance:**  What are compactions (minor vs. major), MOBs, and the block cache? How do they affect read/write latency and storage efficiency?
4. **Fault Tolerance & Coordination:**  How does HBase use ZooKeeper, WAL replay, and region re‑assignment to handle failures and maintain availability? What happens when a RegionServer crashes?
5. **Scalability & Operations:**  Discuss how HBase scales horizontally, how regions split and are balanced, and what administrative actions (e.g., snapshot, backup, recovery) users might perform.

## Wrapping Up :trophy:
Go over your answers with your mentor and clarify any uncertainties. Relate HBase concepts back to the broader data platform.

## Action Items
- Identify HBase topics you want to delve into further.
- Collect a list of real‑world HBase deployments or related technologies.
- Prepare questions for the next mentor Q&A session.
