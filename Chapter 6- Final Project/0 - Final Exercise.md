## Onboarding Final Exercise 🚀

This exercise focuses on **designing and presenting a complete data pipeline architecture** using the department’s stack: **Airflow, Spark, Trino, S3/HDFS, SQL DB**.  
The **pipeline and technologies are the core** of this exercise.  
The scenario/story exists **only to justify the usage of these technologies**, not the other way around. 
**Pay atention** , using ai tools or viewing past members project doucuments as example are forbidden. 

---
### 🏗 Core Exercise Requirements
1. **The pipeline must be the central component** – all stages of the process must be clearly shown.
2. **Technologies must be justified**:  
   - **Airflow**: orchestrate dependencies, retries, scheduling.  
   - **Spark**: distributed processing, transformations, aggregations.  
   - **Trino**: query analytics, joins, aggregations, partition pruning.  
   - **S3/HDFS**: scalable storage, partitioning, cost-performance balance.  
   - **SQL DB**: schema definition, querying.  
3. **Scenario/story** exists **only to justify pipeline design**.  
4. **Trade-offs & decisions** must be clearly documented: scaling, performance, operational complexity.  
5. **Operational considerations** must be included: monitoring, alerting, retries, failure handling.

### 🎯 User Story & Minimal Scenario

The scenario should provide **just enough business context** to justify the pipeline and the technologies used.

To define the scenario, you may:
- Identify a **fictional organization or business domain** where data plays a crucial role.
- Define a **problem or challenge** that requires a data pipeline solution.
- Describe **what data is generated**, how often it arrives, and why it needs to be processed or analyzed.

The goal is **not storytelling**, but rather providing a **clear motivation for the pipeline design**.

The scenario must still **remain minimal**, as the focus of the exercise is the **pipeline architecture and technology usage**, not the business narrative.

Example scenarios may include:
- Event analytics for a digital platform
- Daily ETL pipelines for reporting
- Operational monitoring or log analytics systems

Show the **data flow clearly**:  
**Ingestion → S3/HDFS → Spark → Trino → SQL queries**

Emphasize **technology choices and architectural reasoning**, not the story itself.

### ⏳ Timeline
Total Duration: 2 Weeks + 1 Day Presentation

#### **Week 1: Planning & Design**
  - Identify minimal business context that justifies each technology in the stack.  
  - Define data types, volume, arrival frequency, and latency requirements.  
  - Sketch **end-to-end pipeline** including ingestion, storage, processing, orchestration, and query layers.  
  - Decide **Storage layout, partitioning, file formats**, and lifecycle policies.  
  - Define **Spark job structure**, transformations, dependencies, and failure handling.  
  - Draft Airflow DAGs: scheduling, dependencies, retries, and monitoring.  

#### **Week 2: Execution & Refinement**
  - Finalize pipeline architecture diagrams.  
  - Model **Trino tables and queries** with optimizations for partitioning, joins, and aggregations.  
  - Implement the core of the pipeline: simulate workflow orchestration, scaling, and failure scenarios.  
  - Document pros/cons of each design decision within the stack.  
  - Prepare **team-focused discussion points** emphasizing design choices and trade-offs.  

#### ** Last Day: Presentation**
- Create a presentation that includes the **complete pipeline architecture** to present to the team. 
- Lead **technical discussion**:
  - Explain why each technology is used and how it integrates.  
  - Show **data flow**, orchestration, and query execution.  
  - Discuss scalability, fault tolerance, and operational strategies.  
  - Highlight limitations, trade-offs, and future improvements.

## 🧩 Required Deliverables & Action Items
The final submission must include **clear artifacts demonstrating the full pipeline implementation and design**.  
All deliverables should follow the structure described in the **Project Template**.

---

### 1️⃣ Pipeline Architecture

Provide a **Pipeline Diagram** that clearly illustrates:

- **End-to-end data flow**
- Interactions between the main components in the stack:
  - Airflow
  - Spark
  - Storage layer (S3 / HDFS)
  - Trino
  - SQL DB layer / analytics consumers

The diagram must include the following stages:

- Data ingestion
- Storage layer
- Processing layer
- Orchestration layer
- Query / analytics layer

Clearly differentiate between **data flow** and **control flow** where applicable.

---

### 2️⃣ Airflow Orchestration

Provide an **Airflow DAG design** that includes:

- DAG structure and task dependencies
- Scheduling configuration
- Retry policies
- Failure handling strategy
- Backfill strategy
- Monitoring / alerting considerations

The DAG must orchestrate **at least one Spark application** within the pipeline.

---

### 3️⃣ Spark Processing Layer

Implement or design a **Spark application** that demonstrates:

- Data ingestion from the storage layer
- Transformations and aggregations
- Writing processed data back to S3/HDFS
- Handling failures and retries
- Justification for distributed processing

Explain the **logic of the transformations** and how the Spark job fits into the overall pipeline.

---

### 4️⃣ Storage Layer Design

Define how data is stored within **S3 or HDFS**:

- File formats (e.g., Parquet, ORC, etc.)
- Partitioning strategy
- Data layout within the data lake
- Retention or lifecycle policies

Explain how these choices impact **performance, scalability, and cost**.

---

### 5️⃣ Query Layer (Trino)

Design the **analytics/query layer** using Trino:

- Trino table definitions
- Example analytical queries
- Query optimization strategies such as:
  - Partition pruning
  - Join strategies
  - Aggregation design

Explain how Trino interacts with the underlying storage layer.

---

### 6️⃣ Operational Considerations

Describe how the pipeline would be **operated in a production environment**:

- Monitoring
- Alerting
- Logging
- Failure recovery

---

### 7️⃣ Trade-offs & Design Decisions

Document the key architectural decisions made during the design process:

- Why each technology in the stack is used
- Alternative approaches that were considered
- Trade-offs between:
  - Performance
  - Maintainability
  - Operational complexity
  - Scalability

Explain the **reasoning behind the final design choices**.

---

### 🔎 Technical Discussion Focus
- **Explain why each technology is mandatory** for this pipeline.  
- **Show data flow** from ingestion to query.  
- **Discuss scalability** and **fault tolerance**.  
- **Highlight trade-offs** between performance, maintainability, and operational complexity.  
- **Show failure handling**: retries, backfills, monitoring.

### 🎨 Presentation Tips
- Diagrams should illustrate **data flow and component interactions**.  
- Focus on **design decisions and architecture**, not scenario narrative.  
- Prepare for questions on:
