# Day 12 - Python internals üêç

## Overview

Welcome to chapter 3! Todays session is all about the internals of the `Python` programming language. You will dive into the behind the scenes of one of the most popular programming languages today.

## Goals

- Understand the Python attitude to writing code.
- Know all about what happens when you run a python program.
- Learn how the vast number of Python features can be integrated into your code.

## Time limit

The time limit for this session is a day and a half (including discussions & re-dos).

## Python book

During this part, you will read some chapters out of `O'Reilly's Learning Python` book.
You can access the book via [this](https://cfm.ehu.es/ricardo/docs/python/Learning_Python.pdf) link.

- Chapter 2: How Python runs
- Chapter 10: Introducing Python statements
- Chapter 14: Iterations and comprehensions.
- Chapter 16: Function basics

You may, of course, explore regions other subjects the interest you within the book, as you long as you stay within the designated time period that your mentor has given you.

## Design patterns

This section is about the various design patterns and their usages.

Firstly, read what even is a `design pattern`, then, read about the following design patterns:

- TDD
- Repository pattern
- Factory method

## Discussion

During this part, you and your mentor will take part in another discussion, to verify your knowledge in the subjects you have learned.

You may use the following questions as a guide to help you prepare. Note that the questions you will be asked during the discussion will be different from the ones that are listed here to help you prepare.

1. What is the Python interpreter?
2. Given that variables with Python are not declared with a type, why may a Python program raise a TypeError?
3. Explain the connection between C and Python.
4. Tuple vs. List
5. What is a python package?
6. What is a JIT compiler in Python?
7. How can one run Java from a Python program (hint: Py4J)
8. Explain what are design patterns and give 2 examples for design patterns.

## Wrapping up

Today, you studied the internals of the Python programming language and its vast variety of unique and groundbreaking features that made it so popular with modern developers, as well as being one of the most accessible programming language out there for new developers.

Congratulations for completing day 12!
