# Day 14 - Setting up your development environment üè†

## Overview

Welcome to day 14! This day is all about configuring your local development environment internally (within the closed network) to prepare for the practical exercises of these chapters.

## Goals

- Have a working, ready to go development environment.

## Time limit

The time limit for this session is half a day.

## IDE configuration

### Installation

Pay attention ‚ö†Ô∏è - there will be no additional designated time for you to configure another IDE, choose wisely.

You have essentially 2 options (3 if you are brave).

- Pycharm
- Visual Studio Code

The installation wizards can be found in the `applications` windows-share (you have probably used this share folder before to install other programs) within the closed network. If you don't know the exact routing, you may ask your mentor for assistance.

### Testing

Test yourself, try the following to make sure you successfully installed and configured your development environment:

- Attempt to run a simple Python program that prints out "Hello World" to the screen.
- Attempt to debug that program.
- Install a package, like `pydantic` using pip.

## Wrapping up

Congrats! You now have a working local development environment. This is yet another critical step on your development journey.

Congratulations for completing day 14!
