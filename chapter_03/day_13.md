- Learn basic programming rhetorics like `MR` `DR` etc.
- Learn how discussions are held within coding groups.

## Lecture

TODO: Add lecture presentation.

### Student instructions

This part is purely verbal between you and your mentor.
During this lecture, you will learn all you need to know about the process of actually writing code within a development group. This part is not "testing" feel free to ask your mentor questions.

### Mentor instructions

Mentor - like the first lecture, note the comments on each talking points in the slide's "notes" section.
Download the presentation `the-philosophy-of-writing-code.pptx` to your computer and study it. Once you feel ready - call your newbie and present it. If you see fit and there's time - feel free to encourage further exploration by your student.

## Action Items

- Identify regions for deeper exploration, if you find something that catches your eye, feel free to ask your mentor for additional time to study it.
- Ask questions, even after the presentation.
- Critical thinking - if something doesn't make sense to you, challenge what you've been told.

## Wrapping up

Today, you learned how the process of writing code within a group works.
This is an important step in your journey to becoming a real developer.

Congratulations for completing day 13!
