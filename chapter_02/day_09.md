## Lecture

Please refer to the corresponding instructions depending on your role.

### Student instructions

This section is a one on one lecture of you and your mentor. Contact your mentor to begin. If your mentor is unavailable or busy, you may continue to the next chapter meanwhile, and resume this part when your mentor becomes available.

### Mentor instructions

During this part, you will present the presentation named `initial-development-lecture.pptx` to your student. Download it to your computer and study it.
For your comfort, the presentation is written in hebrew.
Each talking point in each slide, has an explanation in the notes of the slide. Before starting the lecture, iterate over the slides in the presentation, and make sure you thoroughly understand the talking points, to be able to answer your student's questions.

This presentation is interactive, and is not meant to **test** your student's knowledge, but rather asses it. By asking questions about some talking points, you can figure out which subjects will require more attention during their onboarding. You may answer your student's questions, or you may choose to let them figure it out themselves during the corresponding chapter in their onboarding.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Critical** - make sure not to go too deep into the subjects. This meeting is an overview and will lose its purpose if you really dive in into each and every subjects.
