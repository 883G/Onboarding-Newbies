# Day 11 - Embarking on the Docker Journey :ship:

## Overview:   
Today, we're setting sail on a journey into the world of Docker, a powerful tool that has revolutionized the way software is developed, tested, and deployed. Docker's containerization technology has become a cornerstone of modern software development, enabling teams to build, ship, and run applications consistently across different environments.

## Goals:
- Introduce new team members to Docker, its ecosystem, and its significance in modern software development.
- Provide hands-on experience with Docker to understand its functionalities and benefits.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:**
- Emphasize the practical applications of Docker in development, testing, and deployment workflows.
- Encourage exploration and experimentation to foster a deep understanding of Docker concepts.

## 1. Introduction to Docker

### Core Concepts

1. **Docker Basics:**
   - Understand what Docker is and the core concepts of containers.
   - Discuss the benefits of Docker in creating consistent and isolated environments.

2. **Docker Components:**
   - Explore key Docker components such as images, containers, Dockerfiles, and Docker Compose.
   - Understand the role of each component in the Docker ecosystem.

3. **Containerization vs Virtualization:**
   - Compare containerization with traditional virtualization.
   - Discuss how Docker optimizes resource utilization and speeds up development processes.

4. **Docker Hub and Repositories:**
   - Get familiar with Docker Hub and how to find, share, and use container images.
   - Understand the importance of versioning and maintaining images in repositories.

5. **Docker Networking:**
   - Understand the basics of Docker networking and how containers communicate with each other and the outside world.
   - Explore different network drivers and their use cases.

6. **Docker compose:**
   - Learn how to use Docker Compose to define and run multi-container applications.
   - Understand the role of YAML files in defining Docker Compose applications. 

## 2. Hands-on Docker Labs

**Practical Exercises:**
- [Docker Labs](https://kodekloud.com/courses/labs-docker-for-the-absolute-beginner-hands-on/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=labs&utm_campaign=docker)

## Wrapping Up:
- Discuss the experiences, challenges, and any difficulties faced during the hands-on sessions.
- Encourage team members to share their thoughts on how Docker can be integrated into their current or future projects.

Congratulations on completing Day 07! You've taken a significant step in mastering Docker, an essential tool in the toolkit of modern developers. üê≥
- Discuss with your mentor about the day's learnings and explore potential project applications. Reflect on the significance of Docker and how you can apply these concepts in your coding endeavors.

## **Q&A Session:** :raising_hand:
- Answer the following basic questions with your mentor:
  * What is Docker and why is it used?
  * What is a Docker container? How does it differ from a virtual machine?
  * What's the diffrence between Docker image to a Docker container?
  * What is the purpose of a Dockerfile?
  * Can you describe the process of creating and using a custom Docker image?
  * What are docker layers? how they are created?
  * What's most common base image operation system that every docker built-on? what's the pro's and con's of it? (Alternative phrase: "Why would you want to switch the base image to a diffrent operation system?)
  * What is Docker Compose and what are its use cases?

## Action Items:
- Identify areas for deeper exploration.
- Get recommendations on resources for further learning.
- Reflect on how you can integrate Docker into your current or future projects.
