# Day 11 - Openshift fundamentals :ship:

## Overview

In this session, you will learn about `Openshift`, the industry-standard infrastructure to host production applications. You will learn how an application is deployed over Openshift, and the different objects and components that comprise the Openshift ecosystem.

## Goals

- Understand the problem that Openshift solves, and the way that it solves it.
- Understand Openshift's architecture and features.
- Learn how Openshift's features work together to create a holistic ecosystem.

## Time limit

The time limit for this session is a day.

## Openshift labs

This chapter is **internal**, meaning that the exercises and reading materials are available inside the closed network.

To Access them, open your PC that is connected to the closed network (if you don't have one yet - talk to your mentor). Once in, go to your chosen browser and type in the search bar the address: `http://go/orcalabs`.

These exercises are similar to the Docker labs that you have already completed.
To complete this day, you are required to successfully finish the first and second labs. Note that sometimes the labs may bug out, so if something seems odd, like, for example, pods stuck on pending - feel free to approach your mentor for assistance.

## Openshift and Docker discussion

During this section, you and your mentor will have a discussion on the material you have learned in the past two days. This discussion is meant to asses and verify your knowledge in the subjects. If your mentor is unavailable, feel free to prepare yourself in the meantime.

## Wrapping up

During the past two days, you learned how modern-day developers deploy code seamlessly in multiple machines, and how code is being shipped and deployed in production environments. Continue on your journey to become a developer, keep curious!

Congratulations on completing day 11 and chapter 2!
