# Day 10 - Embracing Docker

## Overview

Today, we're setting sail on a journey into the world of Docker, a powerful tool that has revolutionized the way software is developed, tested, and deployed. Docker's containerization technology has become a cornerstone of modern software development, enabling teams to build, ship, and run applications consistently across different environments.

## Goals

- Understand the background story of Docker and the problem that is solves.
- Understand the core concepts of containers.
- Learn basic Docker commands.

## Time limit

The time limit for this session is half a day.

## Introduction to Docker

### Docker Basics

- Understand what Docker is and the core concepts of containers.
- Discuss the benefits of Docker in creating consistent and isolated environments.

### Docker Components

- Explore key Docker components such as images, containers, Dockerfiles etc.
- Understand the role of each component in the Docker ecosystem.

### Docker compose

- Learn how to use Docker Compose to define and run multi-container applications.
- Understand the role of YAML files in defining Docker Compose applications.

### Reading sources

You may use (but are not limited) these sources:

- [What is Docker](https://aws.amazon.com/docker/#:~:text=Docker%20is%20a%20software%20platform,tools%2C%20code%2C%20and%20runtime.)
- [Docker Wikipedia entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software))
- [The Docker architecture](https://sysdig.com/learn-cloud-native/docker-101-the-docker-components/#:~:text=alternative%20to%20Kubernetes.-,The%20Docker%20Architecture,-The%20core%20components)
- [Docker Compose documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Docker Labs

Hands on exercise with Docker. You will need to sign in to enroll in the course. You may enroll with your Google account. [Docker hands on exercise](https://kodekloud.com/courses/labs-docker-for-the-absolute-beginner-hands-on/?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=labs&utm_campaign=docker)

## Q&A Session :raising_hand:

- Answer the following basic questions with your mentor:
- What is Docker and why is it used?
- What is a Docker container? How does it differ from a virtual machine?
- What's the diffrence between Docker image to a Docker container?
- What is the purpose of a Dockerfile?
- Can you describe the process of creating and using a custom Docker image?
- What are docker layers? how they are created?
- What's most common base image operation system that every docker built-on? what's the pro's and con's of it? (Alternative phrase: "Why would you want to switch the base image to a different operation system?)
- What is Docker Compose and what are its use cases?

## Action Items

- Identify areas for deeper exploration.
- Get recommendations on resources for further learning.
- Reflect on how you can integrate Docker into your current or future projects.

Congratulations on completing Day 10! You've taken a significant step in mastering Docker, an essential tool in the toolkit of modern developers. üê≥
